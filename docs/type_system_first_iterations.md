# Type System first iteration

We need to capture technical requirements for implementing a type system that first captures a Tensor's dimensions and potentially its shape. This will use simple functions from the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html). The goal is capture the tensor's shape and dimensions in a type.
